<h3>Who We&#160;Are</h3>
	<p>The Southwest Church Planting Network is a voluntary joint subcommittee of elders created to serve the Houston Metro, North Texas, South Texas, and Southwest Presbyteries, strategically expanding Christ’s Kingdom by planting new <span class="caps">PCA</span> churches and <span class="caps">RUF</span> chapters in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. </p>

	<p>Church planting networks are in place and are being established throughout the <span class="caps">PCA</span>, as a growing number of church plants in our denomination are now being done through those networks.  A church planting network brings together scarce resources of talent, money, and expertise, strategically focusing them toward accomplishment of a common objective. In the Southwest, this is particularly important since the <span class="caps">PCA</span> is still spread so thin over the four states.</p>

	<p>Most of the churches in the Network are relatively young.  Many are only a few years old, and many have been planted by other participating churches in the Network.  We are faced with the challenge of growing our own churches while planting others.  Some may see this as an overwhelming task, but we view it as an opportunity for great faith.</p>

	<p>Planting new churches and <span class="caps">RUF</span> chapters requires vision, commitment, time and effort, which must come together just to form the plans.  Then, in God&#8217;s providence, the resources must be brought to bear on the task.</p>

	<p>The Network has the support of the Mission to North America (<span class="caps">MNA</span>) or Missions Committees of all four Presbyteries as well as the Missions to North America Committee of the General Assembly (<span class="caps">MNA</span>/GA) in Atlanta. The Network activities do not replace either of these organizations but instead enhance their efforts and accelerate the building of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. The <span class="caps">MNA</span> (or Missions) Committees of the Presbyteries still act independently and have budgets of their own for church planting and <span class="caps">RUF</span> work that is not addressed by the Network. Part of the commitment that a church makes to participate in the Network is that it will annually contribute .75% of its operating budget to their local Presbytery for its ongoing work. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">MNA</span>/GA sees Networks as the future for planting new <span class="caps">PCA</span> churches. They envision moving some of their centralized functions such as the Assessment Center out to the various regions of the country to reduce travel expenses and better meet the unique needs of the regional churches. Jim Bland, the coordinator for the denomination&#8217;s Mission to North America (<span class="caps">MNA</span>/GA), has said that the Southwest Church Planting Network would be the natural choice for locating decentralized services for the Southwest when the timing is right. As long as there is an effective centralized service being provided by <span class="caps">MNA</span>/GA, the Network plans to take advantage of it and not duplicate resources.</p>

	<p>There are three major objectives of the Network.
	<ol>
		<li>Identifying and training leaders</li>
		<li>Planting churches and new <span class="caps">RUF</span> chapters</li>
		<li>Nurturing new plants until full maturity</li>
	</ol></p>

	<p>The individual Presbyteries still have complete authority and control over specific church plants contemplated and started within its boundaries. More specifically, the Network, prior to moving ahead with implementation or publicity, must do the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Notify the appropriate Presbytery <span class="caps">MNA</span> or Missions Committee as soon as a new church plant or a new <span class="caps">RUF</span> chapter is being seriously contemplated.</li>
		<li>Consult with the Sessions of other <span class="caps">PCA</span> churches near the proposed target area.</li>
		<li>Receive site approval from the appropriate Presbytery.</li>
		<li>In the case of a church plant, receive Presbytery <span class="caps">MNA</span> or Missions Committee approval of the philosophy of ministry.</li>
		<li>Receive Presbytery <span class="caps">MNA</span> or Missions Committee approval of the business plan.</li>
		<li>Arrange for an interview of the organizing pastor or <span class="caps">RUF</span> candidate with the Presbytery <span class="caps">MNA</span> or Missions Committee and receive their endorsement of the candidate.</li>
		<li>Ensure all candidates satisfy the credential requirements through the Candidates and Examinations Committee of the appropriate Presbytery.</li>
		<li>Send copies of advertisements that will employ the <span class="caps">PCA</span> name and logo to the appropriate Presbytery <span class="caps">MNA</span> or Missions Committee.</li>
		<li>Report twice each year to each Presbytery’s <span class="caps">MNA</span> or Missions Committee in person and twice each year in writing.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Each church needs to look at their participation as at least a three year commitment since the Network will be establishing support obligations that stretch over multiple years. The subcommittee operates according to Standing Rules and reports to the <span class="caps">MNA</span> (or Missions) Committees of all four Presbyteries on a regular basis. </p>

	<p>A church participating in the Network must select an elder (ruling or teaching) to serve on the joint subcommittee that has a heart for church planting. It would be ideal if this elder has some first hand experience in the process or has a particular discipline that would be helpful to nurture and assist new churches. Those elders, selected by each church, serve at the pleasure of their respective Presbyteries. It is desirable that an individual be willing to serve for a minimum of two years and be able to regularly attend joint subcommittee meetings that meet at least twice a year.</p>
